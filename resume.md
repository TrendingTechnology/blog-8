## Biography

I am a Computer Scientist and Web Developer from Caracas, Venezuela. I'm really passionate about Open Source Software, learning new things and sharing them afterwards (if possible). My main interest when woking is web development. I've been working for the past two years and remotely for the last 6 months to avoid spending 3 hours a day commuting. In the past I had spend lot's of my time playing video games and Paintball (which I consider the best sport in the entire world).

## Education

### Universidad Católica Andrés Bello
Caracas, Venezuela — Ingeniería Informática - '12

### Colegio Simón Bolívar II
Caracas, Venezuela — High School - '04

## Skills
Over the years I've used quite a bit of programming languages, I think this is typical when you are forging your path though University to get your degree in Computer Science. Back In 2009 I did a course to from Sun Microsystems to Learn Java Programming Language (SL-275) and in 2012 while I was doing internships/working I did two Oracle courses in System Administration for the Oracle Solaris 10 OS (Part 1 and 2). The programming languages I'm familiar with are: Python, PHP and JavaScript, although I don't use PHP anymore after discovering Ruby. I'm proficient with Java, Ruby, HTML, CSS; and I recently started learning Elixir to see what functional programming is all about. I've been Mac and Linux user for the last six years, so I know my way around the terminal. I'm also using Docker to pack and run the web applications on my laptop and production.

My favorite tools for building web applications are, Ruby on Rails, Jekyll, Sinatra, Sass, Docker and of course I've been heavily relying in Git as my version control tool for everything.

I believe that communications must be asynchronous most of the time, so I mostly use IM and email. I try to be really organized when in a project and Trello helps me achieving this.

## Work Experience

### Writer and Developer.
*Codehero Blog, Internet*

*June 2013 - Present*

I'm a writer at [Codehero.co](http://codehero.co), a blog about programming with all its content written in Spanish. The Idea behind having a technical blog about programming in spanish is to fill a gap that's present; there is almost no good/technical information about programming written in Spanish. We are doing this for the sake of love to our career.

I've been writing about Git, Sinatra and now Ruby on Rails. We are also migrating the blog from WordPress to Jekyll to make it faster, easier to maintain, modify and cheaper for all of us. We also plan to Open Source the project once we finish the migration.

### Junior Android Developer.

*Aura Internacional*
*Caracas, Venezuela*

*June 2013 - December 2013*

My work at Aura International was building an Android application using their commercial vehicle satellite tracking API. This was my first time building a useful Android Application, I'd used the new Android Studio as the IDE, worked on services using mainly UDP for communication, Geo Location, SQLite and Local Broadcasting within the services and the application activities. I've learned a lot from the Android Ecosystem and Java while working in this project.

### Web Developer and Junior System Administrator.
*Cacao Servicios Tecnológicos*
*Caracas, Venezuela*

*March 2012 - March 2013*

When I started my internships at Cacao Servicios Tecnológicos I was hired to migrate their Joomla website to a Rails Application. They needed/wanted to have a flexible application they can extend without the hassle of workarounds and plugins within the Joomla ecosystem. Once I finished the migration and since they are Oracle Partners here in Venezuela, Panamá and Costa Rica they where searching for a Junior System Administrator who was able to work for a few months in two of the biggest Telecoms in Venezuela, Movistar and Movilnet, helping their current System Administrators. At this point they gave me the Solaris Administration courses to be prepared for what I was going to encounter while working (Patching the OS, Live Updating, etc.). After almost 3 months I went back working in their website adding more functionality. I grew far more familiar with various technologies like: Ruby, Python, Shell Script, vim, MySQL and some server technologies like nginx. It was also my first time automating deployments, so I used Capistrano. Till this day I'm using much of the things I learn while working with them.

### Freelancing and Open Source
While doing my regular job and the blog I also do some freelancing and Open Source Software.

- I crafted [my own website](https://github.com/albertogg/albertogg.github.com) (this one) using Jekyll and hosted in Github Pages (the code is completely free).
- While trying to learn a bit of Python, I started to use `Flask microframework` and I manage to accomplish my most popular Open Source project; a [flask applications skeleton](https://github.com/albertogg/flask-bootstrap-skel).
- A Ruby gem to handle Markdown and ERB templates in Rails using `Redcarpet` called [Carpetbomb](https://github.com/albertogg/carpetbomb).
- I've been trying to contribute to [Jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll) and [Jekyll Import](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-import) as much as I can.
- I coded the website (it's not live atm) for a local company called Rec Producciones. They gave me freedom to choose the coding language of my preference so I chose Ruby, using Rails. The application is hosted on Heroku using Mailchimp Mandrill's API for sending emails, `sucker_punch` for processing them in the background and `high_voltage` for all the static pages.
