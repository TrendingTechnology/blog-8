# Projects

Over the last couple of years I've worked on a number of projects, some of them are Open Source, other were for the University, but almost all of them are hosted in Github, and the rest in Bitbucket.

## Open Source

- [Flask-bootstrap-skel](https://github.com/albertogg/flask-bootstrap-skel) - A skeleton for Python Flask applications. 2012-

For the complete list checkout my [github profile.](http://github.com/albertogg)


## Websites

- [Cacaoenbytes.com](http://cacaoenbytes.com) - My final University project. 2013
